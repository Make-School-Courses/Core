# Core
Think Big.

After winter break, core focuses on a big group project with other 4-5 engineers. You will specialize in a particular role (front end, back end, etc) and execute an ambitious project to impact the world.

You'll get hands on experience navigating team dynamics. We'll cover organizational psychology research on what makes teams thrive. We'll simulate hands on experience troubleshooting the most common communication challenges that teams face.

Core culminates with Demo Night presentations of your shipped product. It's a stellar opportunity to showcase your work and what you've learned this school year.
